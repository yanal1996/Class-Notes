### growth mindset summery 
**Growth** mindset basically states that genetics and inteligence are not as important as hard work. People with growth mindsets can overcome challanges by extra practice and hard work. 

* My personal reminders of how to stay in a growth mindset is its not easy, very difficult actually, and that is why you need to stay in it because most people are too lazy to do so therfore, you have little competition. 

* Second reminder is my urge to leave something for this earth. Most people just survive, some live, almost none change. 

* Third reminder is the negative push towards extra thought and free time.

If you wonder how I plan all that, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. Break the cycle, focus on science

#### 02a - Learning Markdown

In this part, we learned what Markdown is and how to utilize it on github to create web pages without the need to code in html. we learned how to make organized and unorganized lists, make links, add photos, add paragraphs and headings, and many more. We also watched a video about github pages where it explained how to share these webpages using this tool and focus more on the website content rather than how te deliver the content. We also saved a cheat sheat about common github codes used frequently.
