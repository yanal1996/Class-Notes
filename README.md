### growth mindset summery 
**Growth** mindset basically states that genetics and inteligence are not as important as hard work. People with growth mindsets can overcome challanges by extra practice and hard work. 

* My personal reminders of how to stay in a growth mindset is its not easy, very difficult actually, and that is why you need to stay in it because most people are too lazy to do so therfore, you have little competition. 

* Second reminder is my urge to leave something for this earth. Most people just survive, some live, almost none change. 

* Third reminder is the negative push towards extra thought and free time.

If you wonder how I plan all that, I hate to break it to you but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. Break the cycle, focus on science
