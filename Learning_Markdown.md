In this part, we learned what Markdown is and how to utilize it on github to create web pages without the need to code in html. we learned how to make organized and unorganized lists, make links, add photos, add paragraphs and headings, and many more. We also watched a video about github pages where it explained how to share these webpages using this tool and focus more on the website content rather than how te deliver the content. We also saved a cheat sheat about common github codes used frequently.
